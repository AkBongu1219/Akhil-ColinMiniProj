### Exercise 2

Created the Super Mario Theme. Citations are in the code

### Exercise 3
I created a Firebase project called "EC463 Mini-Project" and created a realtime database within that project. I modified the code for the game to connect the Raspberry Pi to Wifi and then upload game data (minimum response time, maximum response time, average response time, and score) automatically to that database as a JSON file. In order to ensure that the game was performing and uploading data correctly I played three test games, one where I never pressed the button, one where I pressed the button for every light, and one where I pressed the button at five of the ten lights. I then downloaded the data from Firebase and included it in our Github.
